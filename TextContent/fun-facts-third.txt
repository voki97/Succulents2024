<span class="startLetter">Cacti size</span><br>
                        Cacti vary in size and shape. The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a
                        maximum recorded height of 19.2 m, and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputana, only about 1 cm
                        in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb
                        as much as 760 liters of water during a rainstorm.
