<span class="startLetter">Snake Plant</span> - Sansevieria trifasciata
                    Native to West Africa, the snake plant is one of the
                    easiest succulents to cultivate. It can be neglected for long
                    periods of time and still maintain its fresh look. This plant
                    has long, variegated leaves in different shades of green. It
                    is one of the most tolerant types of indoor succulents
                    and can survive in rooms with low light and little water.
                    NASA research says this plant can even improve the air quality in
                    your home by removing toxins and pollutants while you
                    sleep!
