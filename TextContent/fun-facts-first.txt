                        Almost 96% species of family Aizoaceae are endemic to arid or semiarid parts of Southern Africa
                        in the Succulent Karoo. The Succulent Karoo is a ecoregion defined by the World Wide Fund for
                        Nature to include regions of desert in South Africa and Namibia and a biodiversity hotspot. The
                        Succulent Karoo is notable for the world's richest flora of succulent plants, and harbours about
                        one-third of the worldâ€™s approximately 10,000 succulent species. 40% of its succulent plants are
                        endemic. It is literally a desert bursting with flowers.
