<span class="startLetter">Burro's-tail</span> - Sedum morganianum <br>
                    Also known as the donkey tail plant, this succulent is
                    one of the easiest plants to propagate and care for,
                    which makes it a popular houseplant. The burroâ€™s tail
                    was given its name because of its ability to grow up to
                    four inches long with a shape that resembles a tail. This succulent
                    grows best indoors, placed in a well-drained container,
                    where its long stems can drape down off of the edges
                    of the pot.
