<span class="startLetter">Jade Plant</span> - Crassula ovata<br>
                    The jade plant is similar to a bonsai plant in
                    the way that it grows and is maintained. It has
                    a thick trunk with branches that jut out like a
                    miniature tree.
                    Some varieties of the jade plant develop a red
                    color at the tip of the leaf. Once the plant matures
                    and if the conditions are right, the jade
                    plant can develop beautiful white or pink
                    flowers that bloom in the shape of a star.
