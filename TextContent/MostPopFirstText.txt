<p>&emsp;<span class="startLetter">Succulents</span> are now seen in everything from boutonnieres to
                    hanging planters. They are a trend that is taking over not
                    just gardens, but wedding and home decor as well. Succulents are known for their low maintenance and
                    long lifespans,
                    which makes them great for people who work all day, are on the go or just arenâ€™t great at taking
                    care of plants. These
                    plants are great for adding structure and vibrance to gardens and homes. There are many types of
                    succulents that can
                    be used as corner plants in a home office or pops of color in a lush garden. Here are some of the
                    most popular
                    succulents for your home.</p>
