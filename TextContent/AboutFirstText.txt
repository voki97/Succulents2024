<span class="startLetter">In botany,</span> succulents are plants with parts that are
                thickened, fleshy, and engorged,
                usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. It is a characteristic that
                is not used scientifically for the definition of most families and genera of plants because
                often, it only can be used as an accurate characteristic at the single species level. The word
                succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning 'juice', or 'sap'. Succulent plants may store
                water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. Some definitions also include roots, thus
                geophytes that survive unfavorable periods by dying back to underground storage organs may be
                regarded as succulents. In horticultural use, the term succulent is sometimes used in a way
                that excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti.
                Succulents are often grown as ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual appearance,
                as well as their ability to thrive with relatively minimal care. Many plant families have multiple
                succulents species found within them. In following families most species are succulents:
