<span class="startLetter">1. Choose a container with drainage</span><br>
                        Succulents don’t like to sit in waterlogged soil, so drainage is important to prevent rot. Your
                        container should have a drainage hole to allow excess water to escape. Terra-cotta pots are
                        ideal for beginners. <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">2. Make sure your succulents get enough light and rotate
                            them</span><br>
                        Succulents love light and need about six hours of sun per day, depending on the type of
                        succulent. Newly planted succulents can scorch in direct sunlight, so you may need to gradually
                        introduce them to full sun exposure or provide shade with a sheer curtain. Succulents love
                        direct sun, but if yours is sitting in the same exact spot day after day, it's likely that only
                        one side is getting enough light. Succulents will lean towards the sun, so rotating them will
                        help them stand up straight. <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">3. Water according to the season and in the soil directly</span><br>
                        Just like us, succulents need more energy when they're in a period of growth. During the spring
                        and summer, the plants are thriving and drinking up much more water than when they're resting in
                        the fall and winter. When the top 1.25 inches are dry, grab your watering can. Overwatering can
                        kill your succulent, so make sure you let the soil dry between watering.
                        When you water your succulents, soak the soil until water runs out of the drainage holes. Don’t
                        use a spray bottle to water your succulents—misting can cause brittle roots and moldy leaves.

                        <span class="startLetter">4. Plant succulents in the right soil</span><br>
                        Succulents need soil that drains, so regular potting soil—or dirt from your yard—won’t do.
                        Choose cactus soil or mix potting soil with sand, pumice, or perlite. Succulent roots are very
                        fragile so be gentle when repotting. <br>
                        <span class="startLetter">5. Get Rid of Bugs</span><br>
                        Pests shouldn’t be a problem for indoor succulents, but occasionally you may have to deal with
                        bugs. Gnats are attracted to succulents that are planted in soil that is too wet and doesn’t
                        have proper drainage. To get rid of eggs and larvae, spray the soil with 70 percent isopropyl
                        alcohol. Mealybugs are another pest succulent owners have to deal with. Overwatering and
                        overfertilizing are the common causes of mealybugs. Move infected plants away from other
                        succulents and spray with 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. <br>
