The habitats of these water-preserving plants are often in areas with high temperatures and low
                    rainfall, such as deserts. Succulents have the ability to thrive on limited water sources, such as
                    mist and dew, which makes them equipped to survive in an ecosystem that contains scarce water
                    sources.

                    &emsp;<span class="startLetter">By definition,</span> succulent plants are drought resistant plants
                    in which the leaves, stem or roots have become more than usually fleshy by the development of
                    water-storing tissue. Other sources exclude roots as in the definition "a plant with thick, fleshy
                    and swollen stems and/or leaves, adapted to dry environments". This difference affects the
                    relationship between succulents and "geophytes" â€“ plants that survive unfavorable seasons as a
                    resting bud on an underground organ. These underground organs, such as bulbs, corms, and tubers, are
                    often fleshy with water-storing tissues. Thus if roots are included in the definition, many
                    geophytes would be classed as succulents. Plants adapted to living in dry environments such as
                    succulents, are called xerophytes. However, not all xerophytes are succulents, since there are other
                    ways of adapting to a shortage of water, e.g., by developing small leaves which may roll up or
                    having leathery rather than succulent leaves. Nor are all succulents xerophytes, since some plants
                    such as Crassula helmsii are both succulent and aquatic.

                    &emsp;<span class="startLetter">In horticultural use,</span> the term succulent regularly excludes
                    cacti. However, in botanical<br> terminology, cacti are succulents, but not the reverse as many
                    succulent plants are<br> not cacti. Cacti bear true spines and appear only in the New World (the
                    Western<br> Hemisphere), and through parallel evolution similar looking plants evolved in<br>
                    completely different plant families in the Old World without spines, a distinct organ<br> structure.
                    Horticulturists often follow commercial conventions and may exclude<br> other groups of plants such
                    as bromeliads, that scientifically, are considered<br> succulents.

                    <br>
                    A further difficulty for general identification is that plant families (the genus) are<br> neither
                    succulent nor non-succulent and contain both. In many genera and<br> families there is a continuous
                    gradation from plants with thin leaves and normal<br> stems to those with very clearly thickened and
                    fleshy leaves or stems, so the<br> succulent characteristic becomes meaningless for dividing plants
                    into genera<br> and families. Different sources may classify the same species differently.
