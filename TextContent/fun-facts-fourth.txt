<span class="startLetter">Named after cacti</span><br>
                        Opuntias (prickly pears) were used for a variety of purposes by the Aztecs, whose empire,
                        lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital
                        from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the
                        name is that it includes the Nahuatl word n≈çchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The
                        coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image at the
                        center of the myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan.
