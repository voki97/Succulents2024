<span class="startLetter">Flaming Katy</span> - Kalanchoe
                        blossfeldiana<br>
                    The flaming katy is a common
                    houseplant that is native to
                    Madagascar. It prefers temperatures
                    from 60 to 85 degrees, and is
                    extremely sensitive to the cold
                    which is why it is best suited for indoors.
                    The flaming katy grows best in
                    clay pots that have holes at the bottom for
                    drainage.
