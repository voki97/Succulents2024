<span class="startLetter">Zebra Plant</span> - Haworthia fasciata<br>
                    The zebra plant can grow between five
                    and six inches tall and wide. It does not
                    take up a lot of room and does not require
                    much care, so it works well as a houseplant.
                    The zebra plant gets its name from the white
                    variegated stripes on its leaves. These striking
                    leaves point out from its stem in different directions.
                    This plant has shallow roots and is best grown in
                    smaller pots. The zebra plant produces bright yellow, cone
                    shaped flower heads that last about a week. They are
                    dainty, slow-growing and have an eccentric appearance.
