                    This cactus is a member of the prickly pear
                    family that grows evenly spaced clusters of
                    hairs rather than sharp spines. The
                    Mexican native grows clusters of pads
                    that get no larger than two feet tall but
                    can grow up to five feet across over time.
                    Pale yellow blooms are followed by red,
                    edible fruits on plants that receive
                    a full day of sun.
